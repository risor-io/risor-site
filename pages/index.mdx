Risor offers a new way to write scripts, integrate systems, and interact with the cloud.
Enjoy a modern and familiar language with a huge amount of built-in functionality for interacting with databases, HTTP, and more.

You might want to check out the [builtins](/docs/builtins) list or examples of
[AWS SDK usage](/examples/aws) and [querying Postgres](/examples/pgx).

## Quick Example

```go copy
array := ["gophers", "are", "burrowing", "rodents"]

sentence := array | strings.join(" ") | strings.to_upper

print(sentence)
```

Output:

```filename="output"
GOPHERS ARE BURROWING RODENTS
```

## Why Choose Risor?

Risor offers several advantages that make it a great fit for your projects:

- **Versatile**: Work with JSON, HTTP, Kubernetes, databases, and more.
- **Familiar Syntax**: Friendly for Go, Python, and TypeScript developers.
- **Expressive**: Easily create and manipulate lists, maps, and sets.
- **Pipe Expressions**: Quickly build processing pipelines.
- **Single Binary**: The Risor CLI has many built-in modules.
- **DevOps Friendly**: Ideal for automation and system integration tasks.

## Editor

Try running Risor from your browser! The code is evaluated in a cloud region _close to you_.
Note that the final value in the script is what is shown below. **Stdout is not
yet shown**. If you want to know the value of a variable, just add the variable
name as the last line of the script.
