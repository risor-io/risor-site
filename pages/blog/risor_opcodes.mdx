_This post explores Risor's compiler and opcodes and shows how the implementation
was influenced by CPython. Risor is an embeddable scripting language for the Go
ecosystem. If you find Risor interesting, consider joining the growing community
of contributors at [github.com/risor-io/risor](https://github.com/risor-io/risor)._

## Background

Earlier in 2024, I built a compiler and virtual machine for Risor that
executes instructions in the form of opcodes. This was a significant upgrade
for the project, most notably making Risor _significantly_ faster.

It was also less work than I expected. I was able to get some early quick wins,
which made me feel the progress and gave me the confidence to continue.

While I referred to [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
during the initial development of Risor (then called Tamarin), I didn't use its
companion "Writing a Compiler in Go". Instead, I heavily referenced CPython's
opcodes. In part, I did this because Risor is influenced by Python, and I
suspected its opcodes would serve me well in Risor.

This approach seems to have worked well.

## The Python Disassembler

In Python, you can inspect the opcodes of a function using the
[dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) module. I used this to reverse
engineer how various snippets of Python compile, and would then take a similar
approach in Risor.

Here's a simple example in Python:

```python showLineNumbers copy filename="example.py"
import dis

def example(a, b):
    return a + b

dis.dis(example)
```

Running that Python code will output:

```
  3           0 RESUME                   0

  4           2 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              6 BINARY_OP                0 (+)
             10 RETURN_VALUE
```

The meaning of this is as follows, using the first LOAD_FAST line as an example:

```
LINE_NUMBER  BYTECODE_OFFSET  OPCODE     OPERAND
-----------  ---------------  ---------  -------
          4                2  LOAD_FAST  0 (a)
```

Python and Risor both use a stack-based virtual machine, in which variables are
pushed onto the stack and then popped off when used in an operation. The two
[LOAD_FAST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_FAST)
opcodes in this example push `a` and `b` onto the stack. The
[BINARY_OP](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#opcode-BINARY_OP)
opcode then pops them both off and pushes the result of the addition
back onto the stack.

The reason for the name LOAD_FAST is that the operation loads a local variable
by its index in the local variables array, which is a fast operation compared to
looking up a variable by name from a hash table.

Using index-based lookups with LOAD_FAST is one of the reasons that Risor
became significantly faster with the introduction of the Risor VM.

You can also run the Python `dis` module on a file like this:

```bash copy filename="bash"
python -m dis ./example.py
```

This way of disassembling is especially useful because it shows the bytecode for
the entire module, including all functions and classes.

## The Risor Disassembler

In Risor, we'll use this equivalent function in a file `example.risor` to compare:

```risor filename="example.risor" showLineNumbers copy
func example(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

As of the [v1.5.0](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/releases/tag/v1.5.0) release,
there is a `risor dis` command that can be used to disassemble Risor scripts.
Provide code via the `--code` flag or provide a path to a Risor script. Here's
an example of using the `risor dis` command to disassemble the "example" function:

```bash copy filename="bash"
risor dis --func example ./example.risor
```

```plaintext filename="output"
+--------+--------------+----------+------+
| OFFSET |    OPCODE    | OPERANDS | INFO |
+--------+--------------+----------+------+
|      0 | LOAD_FAST    |        0 | a    |
|      2 | LOAD_FAST    |        1 | b    |
|      4 | BINARY_OP    |        1 | +    |
|      6 | RETURN_VALUE |          |      |
+--------+--------------+----------+------+
```

The quickest way to see the opcodes for a code snippet is just to pass the
snippet via flags to the command:

```bash copy filename="bash"
risor dis --code 'math.max([1, 3, 0])'
```

```plaintext filename="output"
+--------+-------------+----------+------+
| OFFSET |   OPCODE    | OPERANDS | INFO |
+--------+-------------+----------+------+
|      0 | LOAD_GLOBAL |       45 | math |
|      2 | LOAD_ATTR   |        0 | max  |
|      4 | LOAD_CONST  |        0 | 1    |
|      6 | LOAD_CONST  |        1 | 3    |
|      8 | LOAD_CONST  |        2 | 0    |
|     10 | BUILD_LIST  |        3 |      |
|     12 | CALL        |        1 |      |
+--------+-------------+----------+------+
```

The `INFO` column shows information that the disassembler can deduce about the
operands. In the example just above, `LOAD_GLOBAL` is loading the `math` module
onto the stack, which is at index 45 in the globals array. For constants, the
actual value of the constant is shown in the `INFO` column.

## Risor Opcodes

Risor currently has 50 opcodes. While working on this I found it interesting how
much can be accomplished with a small number of opcodes. This is part of the
reason I felt comfortable with working on this project. The 
[compiler](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/blob/main/compiler/compiler.go) in
Risor is still less than 2000 lines of code, which is very manageable.

Some opcodes in Risor are an exact match of the opcode with the same name in
Python (at the time of writing). In other cases, I took the liberty to simplify
and add opcodes that felt appropriate in Risor.

Here is the complete set of Risor opcodes today. Note `TOS` is an abbreviation
for the value on "top of the stack" and `TOS1` is the value just below `TOS`.

| Opcode                | ID  | Operands                  | Purpose                                                              |

## CPython's Evolving Bytecode

I was somewhat surprised to learn that CPython's bytecode undergoes a constant
evolution. There isn't a promise that bytecode from one version continues to
work in the next version. Python `.pyc` files include a 4 byte magic number that
are associated with the marshalling code, and Python will recompile the `.pyc`
if the magic number no longer matches the running version of Python.

## The Risor VM as a Platform

While not yet set in stone, my intent with Risor is that the bytecode will remain
stable within each major version. The plan would be to add opcodes as needed for
new features, while retaining the behavior of existing opcodes.

This approach for compatibility would even accommodate using Risor's VM as a
platform for other languages, which is intriguing. It could be a JVM but for
the Go ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading! I hope you find Risor's VM and opcodes interesting. It'd be
great to hear your thoughts and feedback. Please drop in on the
[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/discussions) or join the
`#risor` channel on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/).

If you're new to Risor, the quickest way to install it is using Homebrew:

```
brew install risor
```

See you around 👋
