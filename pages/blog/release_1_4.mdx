## Release v1.4.0

Risor v1.4.0 is here! This release includes several interesting new features
that you also might find familiar if you know Go. For anyone new to Risor, it's
a scripting language written in Go that interoperates well with all the existing
Go libraries and its overall ecosystem.

For a quick taste, here's an example of an HTTP server one-liner using the Risor CLI:

```bash copy
risor -c 'http.listen_and_serve(":8085", func(w, r) { "OK" })'
```

## New Features

This release adds support for the `go` and `defer` keywords, channels, HTTP
servers, improved Risor VM cloning, CLI utilities, and `range` and from-import
statement improvements. More details on all of this below.

### New Risor Keywords

The `go` keyword is now supported, with a direct correspondence to the underlying
capability from the Go runtime. This allows you to run Risor code concurrently.
Under the hood, when `go` is used, the active Risor VM is cloned in order to
have a separate Risor frame and data stack for the new goroutine. Since Risor
VMs are lightweight, this is in-fitting with Go's own lightweight goroutines.

```risor
go func(n) {
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        print("count:", i)
    }
}(4)

time.sleep(1)
```

Outputs:

```
count: 0
count: 1
count: 2
count: 3
```

Similarly, there is now Risor support for the Go `defer` keyword, again with a
fairly direct correspondence to the underlying Go feature. Multiple defer
statements can be made and they are executed in reverse order when the function
returns.

```risor
func() {
    defer print("world")
    defer print("hello")
}()
```

Outputs:

```
hello
world
```

### Channels

Channels are now supported and are the primary means of communication between
Risor goroutines. All channels are typed to Risor's `object.Object` type.
Channel buffering is configurable as in Go, and channels can be closed. The
`<-` operator is used to send and receive values.

As a convenience, a new channel can be created simply by calling `chan()` with
an optional buffer size. Creation using `make(chan)` is also supported. Note that
there is no type parameter since all channels are typed to `object.Object`.

Iteration over channels behaves as in Go.

```risor
ch := chan(2)
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
close(ch)

for _, value := range ch {
    print(value)
}
```

### HTTP servers

Risor can now be used to run HTTP servers and it leverages the new HTTP mux
behavior from the Go 1.22 release. I think this really nicely shows how Risor's
concise syntax can be used to quickly put together a simple backend.

As a convenience in Risor, handler return values may be used as the response
body. If the return value is a string or byte slice, it is written to the body
as-is. If the return value is a map or list, it is marshaled to JSON automatically
and written to the body.

Since the `return` statement can also be omitted in Risor, you can also just
have the handler implicitly return the value of the last expression.

```risor
http.handle("/", func(w, r) {
    return "OK"
})

// Explicit write_header and write calls
http.handle("POST /messages", func(w, r) {
    w.write_header(201)
    w.write("message sent")
})

// Using path value feature from Go 1.22, with implicit JSON response marshaling
http.handle("/animals/{name}", func(w, r) {
    return { animal: r.path_value("name") }
})

http.listen_and_serve(":8081")
```

### CLI Apps

It was already possible to write simple CLIs in Risor, but this release adds
more sophisticated support by wrapping [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli).

In your Risor script, use the following shebang line to ensure that CLI args are
passed correctly to the CLI app:

```
#!/usr/bin/env risor --
```

Building the CLI app then looks very similar to how you would do it in Go when
using `urfave/cli`. Create an app, add commands and flags, then run the app.

```risor
#!/usr/bin/env risor --

cli.app({
    name: "encode",
    help_name: "encode",
    description: "Encode input text using various codecs",
    commands: [
        cli.command({
            name: "base64",
            flags: [
                cli.flag({
                    name: "verbose",
                    aliases: ["v"],
                    usage: "Print verbose output",
                    env_vars: ["VERBOSE"],
                    value: false,
                }),
            ],
            action: func(ctx) {
                if ctx.bool("verbose") {
                    // yadda yadda
                }
                for _, text := range ctx.args() {
                    print(encode(text, "base64"))
                }
            }
        }),
    ]
}).run()
```

### Range Over Integers

The `range` statement now supports ranging over integers, as is now available in
Go 1.22:

```risor
for i := range 5 {
    print(i)
}
```

Note that Risor is a bit more flexible with range statements than Go, since
Risor's `range` statement can be used with any object that implements the
Risor `object.Iterable` interface. That's why all these examples work in Risor:

```risor
for i := range [1, 2, 3] {
    print(i)
}

for i, s := range "hello" {
    print(i, s)
}

it := iter(5)
for i := range it {
    print(i)
}
```

### From-Import Improvement

The from-import statement now supports importing multiple names from a package
with optional name aliasing. This is quite similar to Python's from-import behavior.

```risor
from cli import (
    app,
    command,
    flag,
)
```

## Wrapping Up

Thanks for reading about the new release. As usual, please drop in on the
[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/discussions) to share
any feedback or ask questions.

If you're new to Risor, the quickest way to install it is using Homebrew:

```
brew install risor
```

Happy scripting!
