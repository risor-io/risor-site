# Risor v1.8.0 Release

_Published May 18, 2025_

I'm pleased to announce the v1.8.0 release of Risor, which adds a bevy of new
modules and features to make your scripting easier, more fun, and perhaps
weirder than ever.

This is the first Risor release in 2025. Sorry about that. While I'd prefer the
project have a more regular release cadence, this isn't my sole focus, so it is
what it is. I count 44 pull requests merged since the last release, so it truly
is a substantial body of work.

A big shout out to my fellow contributors who authored multiple PRs:

- [@rubiojr](https://github.com/rubiojr)
- [@dnbsd](https://github.com/dnbsd)
- [@saracen](https://github.com/saracen)

Worth a quick call out: Risor is a community project with no commercial
backing. It's contributions big and small that keep the project moving ~and
keep my dreams alive~. Consider joining in if you find the project interesting!

And eff why eye, I'm [@myzie](https://github.com/myzie) and I started this
project back in 2022 as a way to learn more about interpreters. It's continued
growing in fits and starts ever since.

## Release Highlights

Here's a ~quick~ taste of what's new in v1.8.0.

### **Scheduled Tasks**

The new `sched` module provides several ways to schedule both one-shot and
recurring tasks. This lends itself to quickly spinning up a background service
with minimal code.

```risor copy
sched.every("1m", func() { print("hello world!") })
```

### **Web Crawling**

Several new modules provide tools for web crawling and content extraction:

- `playwright` for browser automation
- `goquery` for HTML parsing and DOM manipulation
- `htmltomarkdown` for HTML to Markdown conversion

For example, here's a one-liner using the Risor CLI to fetch a webpage
and convert it to Markdown. I love this one. It captures the essence of what
Risor is all about. Put some of the best tools available in the Go ecosystem
to work for you in a single, concise command.

```bash copy
risor -c 'fetch("https://risor.io").text() | htmltomarkdown | print'
```

Install and launch Playwright and use it to read the Hacker News headlines:

```go copy
playwright.install()

playwright.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com", func(page) {
    entries := page.locator(".athing").all()
    for i, entry := range entries {
        title := entry.locator("td.title > span > a")
        printf("%d: %s\n", i+1, title.text_content())
    }
})
```

In fitting with the Risor philosophy, all of these capabilities are baked right
into the `risor` binary so you can just get to work. No fiddling with dependencies
or fighting with package managers.

### **Slack Client**

This new module makes it incredibly simple to interact with Slack, including
sending messages, querying conversations, uploading files, and more.

```go copy
client := slack.client(getenv("SLACK_TOKEN"))

client.post_message("#project", {text: "Just a test"})

client.upload_file("C12X73344SJ", {
    title: "Example File",
    filename: "example.txt",
    content: "This is the file content",
})
```

### **QR Codes**

QR codes are now pretty mainstream. Turns out they can be easy to generate too.
The Risor `qrcode` module gives you a one-liner to generate a standard QR code.
It also allows for more customization of color, image patterns, and whatnot if
you like being _fancy_ or _unique_.

```go copy
qrcode("https://risor.io").save("qrcode.png")
```

Now you too can avoid all those horrible ad-filled QR code generator websites.
Or make one of your own, *high five*.

### **Risor Code Assistant**

This isn't technically _in_ the Risor release, but I'm calling it out anyways
because it's a recent development and I think it's interesting. Basically, we
are at a disadvantage by not being a mainstream language because ChatGPT and
Claude know relatively little about Risor. Turns out, they actually _do_ know
about it by now, but they don't know it well enough to be useful. So to make LLMs
decent at writing Risor, you need to teach them.

The [Risor Code Assistant (RCA)](https://github.com/rubiojr/rca) is a repository
of context files that help LLMs write Risor effectively.

### **SQL Querying Improvements**

The first version of the Risor SQL module would read all rows into memory before
returning them to the caller. This release adds an opt-in mode that allows for
streaming query results and allows the caller to quit whenever. I know, it
should've been this way from the start.

```go copy
db := sql.connect("sqlite://example.db", {"stream": true}) // <-- opt-in
iterator := db.query("SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY created_at DESC")
for _, row := range iterator {
    print("event:", row.id, row.created_at, row.body)
    if (row.id == 10) { break }
}
```

Ok, everything can't be a highlight. Switching gears.

## Modules

A number of Risor modules were improved, with a general theme of giving Risor
scripts access to more Go standard library functionality. The OS related changes
go beyond that and are worth a quick call out. The idea with those is to more
fully leverage Risor's ability to provide a mock or virtual operating system.
This supports script sandboxing and using alternative stdin/stdout, among other
things.

- Added `add_date` method to the Time object for easier date manipulation ([#311](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/311))
- Added missing documentation for `math.inf` ([#361](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/361))
- Added `math.atan2` function ([#357](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/357))
- Added support for more CLI app attributes ([#326](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/326))
- Use the OS interface in the CLI module ([#299](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/299))
- Enhanced OS module with more user and group functionality ([#348](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/348))
- Exposed Go's `os` package errors for more detailed error handling ([#373](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/373))
- Added `errors.is` function for error comparison ([#367](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/367))
- shlex: Shell-like string parsing based on github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/shlex ([#298](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/298))
- Adjustments to `os.exit` behavior ([#296](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/296), [#327](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/327))

## Language and Toolchain

In this area, we have some important bug fixes and two improvements that I
consider significant. The first is the ability to import modules by path, which
supports more natural module organization. The second is improving compiler
error messages to make it easier to track down `undefined variable` and similar
errors.

- Ability to import modules by path ([#337](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/337))
- File location information in more compiler error messages ([#320](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/320))
- Added `vm.ErrGlobalNotFound` ([#314](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/314))
- Added bitwise and operator ([#380](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/380)) 
- Fixed break statement bug with range loops ([#336](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/336))
- Fixed compound operations with set item ([#324](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/324)) and other compound operation issues ([#325](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/325))
- Fixed import handling in REPL and named functions as expressions ([#293](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/293))

## Go Interop

When Risor is used as an embedded library, it has the ability to wrap arbitrary
Go types as Risor objects, and to proxy function calls on the types. This allows
Risor to be added into existing applications to provide a scripting interface
on top of the existing types in the application. Risor's capabilities in this
area keep improving. In this release, we added support for a couple less common
situations like wrapping struct _value_ types.

- Adjusted proxy behavior on struct value types ([#371](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/371))
- Adjusted proxying to nested struct fields ([#315](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/315))
- Fixed issues with proxying to Go functions that have an `any` typed parameter ([#323](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/323))
- Added mechanism to reuse a global database connection in SQL module ([#347](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/347))
- Added `FSImporter` for importing modules from a Go `fs.FS` filesystem ([#366](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/pull/366))

## Dependencies and Build System

To quickly recap my thinking on Risor's approach to dependencies:

- The Risor CLI (the `risor` binary) is meant to be "batteries included". All
  modules from the core Risor repository are included in the binary that
  is available for install via Homebrew.
- When using Risor as a library, the developer is able to choose which Risor
  modules to use. It should be possible to use a minimal form of Risor that is
  otherwise dependency-free, or very nearly so.
- Additional Risor modules can get installed using `go get`.

This release more fully implements that mindset, at the expense of requiring a
couple minor upgrade steps for some Risor library users, who will need to `go get`
install a couple more Risor modules.

Specifically, these four modules must be individually `go get` installed:

- `github.com/risor-io/risor/modules/color`
- `github.com/risor-io/risor/modules/isatty`
- `github.com/risor-io/risor/modules/tablewriter`
- `github.com/risor-io/risor/modules/yaml`

Then provide them as globals, if desired, using the `WithGlobals` option:

```go copy
risor.WithGlobals(map[string]any{
    "color":   color.Module(),
    "isatty":  isatty.Module(),
    "tablewriter": tablewriter.Module(),
    "yaml":  yaml.Module(),
})
```

## Get Started or Upgrade

Thanks for taking a look at Risor. It's _really_ easy to try out. Just run
`brew install risor` or build from source:

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:risor-io/risor.git
cd risor/cmd/risor
go install
```

I'd love to hear your feedback and see what you're building with Risor. Drop into the
[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/discussions) or join the
`#risor` channel on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/).

Happy scripting, <br/>
