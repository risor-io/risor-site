# exec

## Functions

### command

```go filename="Function signature"
command(file string, args ...string) exec.command
```

Creates a new `exec.command` targeting a specific `file` to execute,
followed by arguments to execute the command with.

Nothing is executed by this function alone, but instead only a [`exec.command`](#type-command)
object is returned. To execute `file`, you must call the [`run`](#commandrun)
method on the [`exec.command`](#type-command) object.

The lookup if `file` executable exists is also not performed until the [`run`](#commandrun)
method is called.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> exec.command("bash")
exec.command("bash")
>>> exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello world")
exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello world")
>>> exec.command("file-that-does-not-exist")
exec.command("file-that-does-not-exist")
>>> cmd := exec.command("date", "-Iseconds")
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd.stdout
"2024-01-09T21:33:48+01:00\n"
```

### look_path

```go filename="Function signature"
look_path(file string) string
```

Searches for an executable named `file` in the directories named by the `PATH`
environment variable.
If `file` contains a slash, it is tried directly and the `PATH` is not consulted.
Otherwise, on success, the result is an absolute path.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> exec.look_path("bash")
"/usr/bin/bash"
```

### exec

```go filename="Function signature"
exec(file string, args list = [], params map = {}) exec.result
```

Searches for an executable named `file`, similarly to the `exec.look_path`
function, and then executes it. The optional parameter `args` are passed as
arguments when executing `file`, and the optional parameter `params` allows
additional configurations for how to execute the `file`.

In effect, it creates a new [`exec.command`](#type-command) object,
configures it using the `params`,
and then executes its [`run`](#commandrun) method.
Except this function returns [`exec.result`](#type-result) instead of
[`exec.command`](#type-command).

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> exec("date")
exec.result(pid: 13289)
>>> exec("date").stdout
"Tue Jan  9 09:21:04 PM CET 2024\n"
>>> exec("date", ["-Iseconds", "--utc"]).stdout
"2024-01-09T20:22:43+00:00\n"
>>> exec("date", ["-Iseconds"], {"env": {"TZ": "America/New_York"}}).stdout
"2024-01-09T15:24:57-05:00\n"
```

Available configuration options for `params`:

```json
{
  "stdout": os.stdout, // type: io.Writer
  "stderr": os.stderr, // type: io.Writer
  "stdin": os.stdin, // type: io.Reader | string | byte_slice
  "dir": "/foo/bar", // working directory
  "env": {
    // values must be string
    "MY_VAR": "123",
    "TZ": "Europe/Berlin"
  }
}
```

## Type command

Returned from the function with the same name: [`exec.command()`](#command).

### command.path

```go filename="Field signature"
command.path string
```

Path of the command to run.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash")
>>> cmd.path
"/usr/bin/bash"
```

### command.dir

```go filename="Field signature"
command.dir string
```

Dir specifies the working directory of the command.
If dir is the empty string, it will run the command in the calling process's
current directory.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "pwd")
>>> cmd.dir = "/tmp"
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd.stdout
"/tmp\n"
```

### command.env

```go filename="Field signature"
command.env list
```

Env specifies the environment of the process.
Each entry is of the form `"key=value"`.
If `env` is nil, the new process uses the current process's environment.
If `env` contains duplicate environment keys, only the last value in the list
for each duplicate key is used.

As a special case on Windows, `SYSTEMROOT` is always added if missing and not
explicitly set to the empty string.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo $MY_VAR")
>>> cmd.env = ["MY_VAR=1234"]
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd.stdout
"1234\n"
```

### command.stdout

```go filename="Field signature"
command.stdout io.Writer
```

The process' standard output pipe. Defaults to a buffer.

If read after process has been executed, and the value was left as default,
then the field will return a string.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2")
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd.stdout
"hello stdout\n"
```

### command.stderr

```go filename="Field signature"
command.stderr io.Writer
```

The process' standard error pipe. Defaults to a buffer.

If read after process has been executed, and the value was left as default,
then the field will return a string.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2")
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd.stderr
"hello stderr\n"
```

### command.run

```go filename="Method signature"
command.run()
```

Run starts the command and waits for it to complete.
Run will error if called multiple times.

The result can be found in the command object's other fields, such as
[`command.stdout`](#commandstdout),
when the process exists with a zero exit code.

To capture the output in the case of a non-zero exit code, use [`try`](../builtins.mdx#try).

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "exit 0")
>>> cmd.run()
>>> cmd2 := exec.command("bash", "-c", "exit 1")
>>> cmd2.run()
exit status 1
>>> cmd3 := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo message from failed app; exit 1")
>>> try(cmd3.run, "uh oh")
"uh oh"
>>> cmd3.stdout
"message from failed app\n"
```

### command.combined_output

```go filename="Method signature"
command.combined_output() byte_slice
```

Similar to [`command.run`](#commandrun), but returns the combined output
of the process' both standard output and standard error as a byte slice.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2")
>>> cmd.combined_output()
byte_slice("hello stdout\nhello stderr\n")
```

### command.output

```go filename="Method signature"
command.output() byte_slice
```

Similar to [`command.run`](#commandrun), but returns the process'
standard output as a byte slice.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2")
>>> cmd.output()
byte_slice("hello stdout\n")
```

### command.environ

```go filename="Method signature"
command.environ() list
```

Returns a copy of the environment in which the command would be run as it is
currently configured.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("bash", "-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2")
>>> cmd.environ()
["TERM=xterm-256color", "SHELL=/bin/bash", "USER=alice", ...]
```

### command.start

```go filename="Method signature"
command.start()
```

Starts the command (in the background) but does not wait for it to complete.
Will error if called multiple times.

After a successful call to `command.start` the [`command.wait`](#commandwait)
method must be called in order to release associated system resources.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("sleep", "5s")
>>> cmd.start() // finishes immediately
>>> cmd.wait() // waits the remaining 5s since start() was called
```

### command.wait

```go filename="Method signature"
command.wait()
```

Waits for the started command to complete.
Will error if command has not yet been started with [`command.start`](#commandstart)
or if called multiple times.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> cmd := exec.command("sleep", "5s")
>>> cmd.start() // finishes immediately
>>> cmd.wait() // waits the remaining 5s since start() was called
```

## Type result

Returned from : [`exec()`](#exec).

### result.pid

```go filename="Field signature"
result.pid int // readonly
```

Process ID of the executed process.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> exec("echo").pid
5375
```

### result.stdout

```go filename="Field signature"
result.stdout string // readonly
```

Standard output of the process.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> result := exec("bash", ["-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2"])
>>> result.stdout
"hello stdout\n"
```

### result.stderr

```go filename="Field signature"
result.stderr string // readonly
```

Standard error of the process.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> result := exec("bash", ["-c", "echo hello stdout; echo hello stderr >&2"])
>>> result.stderr
"hello stderr\n"
```

### result.json

```go filename="Method signature"
result.json() any
```

Attempts to parse the process' standard output and returns that as the
appropriate Risor type.

```go copy filename="Example"
>>> exec("echo", [`[true, "foo", null, 123]`]).json()
[true, "foo", nil, 123]
>>> exec("echo", [`invalid json text`]).json()
value error: json.unmarshal failed with: invalid character 'i' looking for beginning of value
```
