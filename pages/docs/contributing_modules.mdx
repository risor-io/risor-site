# Contributing Modules

Adding new modules to Risor is a great way to get involved with the project.
For example, contributors have added modules for jmespath, sql, and vault.

If the module wraps a package in the Go standard library, then it can be added
by default to the Risor CLI and Go library, since it doesn't introduce additional
dependencies. Otherwise, it can be added as an optional module that must have its
own `go.mod` file. In both cases, the module can live in the same location in this
Git repository.

If, when the module is built, the Go binary size is significantly increased, then
the module should also be put on a Go build tag to make it optional in the Risor
CLI build. This is currently the case for the `aws` and `vault` modules for example.

Here are a few tips on how to do this:

- Create a new directory under `modules` for your module
- In that directory, run `go mod init github.com/risor-io/risor/modules/<name>`
- Mimic the Go code for one of the existing modules, definining a `Module`
  and/or `Builtins` function.
- Update `cmd/risor/root.go` to add the module and/or builtins in the Risor CLI.
- Add a `modules/<name>/<name>.md` file with documentation.
- Add some unit tests in your module.
- Confirm `make test` passes.
- Run `make tidy` to make sure all the go.mod files are up-to-date.
- Open a pull request.
