## Concatenating Strings in Go

Here are a few ways to combine or concatenate multiple strings in Go. Keep in
mind that an existing string can't be changed, that is, strings are immutable.
Instead, each string operation returns a new string. As a result, some ways of
working will be much more efficient than others when performing a large number
of string operations.

### Using the `+` Operator

In Go, the `+` operator is the simplest way to concatenate a small number of strings.
In the example below, the concatenation of the two strings `s1` and `s2` and a space
in between is stored in `result` and then printed.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s1 := "thanks"
	s2 := "for all the fish"
	result := s1 + " " + s2
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
thanks for all the fish
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/h5cbOhW1st6).

### Using `+=`

The `+=` operator is similar, but is used to append a string to the end of an
existing string. In this example, the `+=` operator is used to update the `s1`
variable to build the string "hello, world!".

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s1 := "hello"
	s2 := "world"
	s1 += ", " + s2 + "!"
	fmt.Println(s1)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
hello, world!
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/fTSgpcUj6YT).

### Using `fmt.Sprintf`

Now we'll move on to a more powerful way of working with strings:
[fmt.Sprintf](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#Sprintf). Use this function to format and
build a string from multiple fragments. Formatting "verbs" are prefixed with `%`
and are placeholders for the values that will be inserted into the string. The
`fmt.Sprintf` function returns a new string. The `%s` verb simply inserts a
string value into the result.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	name := "John"
	age := 22
	result := fmt.Sprintf("%s is %d years old", name, age)
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
John is 22 years old
```

Refer to the [fmt package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) for more
information on the other formatting verbs. This also provides a way to justify
text, adjust precision on floating point numbers, and more.

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/jP-U1oUb9D1).

### Using `strings.Join`

Use [strings.Join](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Join) to build a string from a
slice of input strings, with a given separator. This function is more efficient
than using `+` or `+=` because it avoids creating intermediate strings. In the
example below, a sentence is built from a slice of words by using a space as the
separator.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	words := []string{"words", "to", "live", "by"}
	result := strings.Join(words, " ")
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
words to live by
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/9uVxcNgWpQm).

### Using `bytes.Buffer`

The [bytes.Buffer](https://pkg.go.dev/bytes#Buffer) type is useful for building
a string with repeated writes. Like `strings.Join`, this has the advantage of
being efficient by avoiding intermediate string allocations. It also allows for
conditionally adding strings or using a loop during the building process. Use
the buffer's `String()` method to get the final result.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var buffer bytes.Buffer
	buffer.WriteString("with")
	buffer.WriteString(" ")
	buffer.WriteString("great")
	buffer.WriteString(" ")
	buffer.WriteString("power")
	result := buffer.String()
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
with great power
```

If you are purely dealing with strings and don't need to operate on individual
bytes, prefer using the `strings.Builder` type which is discussed next.

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/oX2p4Zd1ZNm).

### Using `strings.Builder`

The [strings.Builder](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Builder) type is similar to
`bytes.Buffer` but is optimized for string operations. This approach is also
very efficient since it avoids intermediate string allocations. It has an
internal buffer that grows as needed. It is ideal for building a dynamically
while using a loop or conditionally adding strings. Use the builder's `String()`
method to get the final result.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	var builder strings.Builder
	builder.WriteString("the")
	builder.WriteString(" ")
	builder.WriteString("quick")
	builder.WriteString(" ")
	builder.WriteString("brown")
	builder.WriteString(" ")
	builder.WriteString("fox")
	result := builder.String()
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```plaintext filename="output"
the quick brown fox
```

## Concatenating Strings in Risor

Generally speaking, Risor supports the same approaches for concatenating strings
as Go. Risor wraps the corresponding Go functionality, so the same performance
characteristics apply. In Risor, you don't need to import any packages or
define a `main` function. You can simply run the code in a `.risor` file.

### Using the `+` Operator

The `+` operator behaves identically in Risor as it does in Go, and is an easy
way to combine strings:

```risor copy filename="example.risor"
s1 := "thanks"
s2 := "for all the fish"
result := s1 + " " + s2
print(result)
```

```plaintext filename="output"
thanks for all the fish
```

With the `risor` CLI installed (**brew install risor**), you can run this example
with the command:

```bash
risor ./example.risor
```

### Using `+=`

Similarly, the `+=` operator is used to append a string to the end of an existing
string in Risor:

```risor copy filename="example.risor"
s1 := "hello"
s2 := "world"
s1 += ", " + s2 + "!"
print(s1)
```

```plaintext filename="output"
hello, world!
```

### Using `sprintf`

Risor has a built-in `sprintf` function that is equivalent to Go's `fmt.Sprintf`:

```risor copy filename="example.risor"
name := "John"
age := 22
result := sprintf("%s is %d years old", name, age)
print(result)
```

```plaintext filename="output"
John is 22 years old
```

### Using `strings.join`

Join a list of strings with a separator using the `strings.join` function. The
`strings` module is available by default in Risor, as are several other of the
most commonly used modules.

```risor copy filename="example.risor"
words := ["words", "to", "live", "by"]
result := strings.join(words, " ")
print(result)
```

```plaintext filename="output"
words to live by
```

### Using Templated Strings

Risor supports string templates, which are a lot like f-strings in Python and
template literals in JavaScript. Use strings with single quotes and `{}` syntax
to insert variables into the string.

```risor copy filename="example.risor"
name := "John"
age := 22
result := '{name} is {age} years old'
print(result)
```

```plaintext filename="output"
John is 22 years old
```
