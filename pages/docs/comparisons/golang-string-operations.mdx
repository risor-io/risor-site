## Golang String Operations

Go provides a rich set of functiontionality for working with strings. This guide
covers various ways to define and operate on strings in Go, including building
multi-line strings, reading and writing text files, and printing Go structs.

### Defining Multiline Strings

The preferred way to write a string that spans multiple lines is to use
a raw string literal, which is enclosed by backticks. Raw string literals
preserve the newlines and any other special characters within the string.
All whitespace is also preserved as-is, so pay attention to indentation!

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := `This is a
multiline
string`
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

```plaintext filename="stdout"
This is a
multiline
string
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/WZK8G1V6PvM).

### Reading and Writing Files

Go provides a simple way to read and write entire files using the
[os.ReadFile](https://pkg.go.dev/os#ReadFile) and [os.WriteFile](https://pkg.go.dev/os#WriteFile)
functions. These functions work with byte slices, so you'll need to convert the
data to and from strings when working with text files.

These functions were added to Go in version 1.16, obsoleting the `ioutil.ReadFile`
and `ioutil.WriteFile` functions that were previously used for this purpose.

Because these functions read and write entire files at once, they are not suitable
for very large files. For those cases, you should use the `os.Open` and `os.Create`
functions instead to work with the data in smaller chunks.

The following example writes a string to a file and then reads it back.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Write a file
	err := os.WriteFile("test.txt", []byte("Don't Panic."), 0644)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	// Read a file
	data, err := os.ReadFile("test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

```plaintext filename="stdout"
Don't Panic.
```

### String Manipulation Functions

Go's standard library includes the `strings` package, which is packed with
useful string manipulation utilities. Here are some of the most commonly used functions:

- `strings.Contains(s, substr)`: Returns true if the string `s` contains the substring `substr`.
- `strings.Split(s, sep)`: Splits the string `s` into a slice of substrings separated by the separator `sep`.
- `strings.Join(slice, sep)`: Concatenates the items in a slice into a single string using the separator `sep`.
- `strings.Trim(s, cutset)`: Removes all leading and trailing characters contained in `cutset` from `s`.
- `strings.ReplaceAll(s, old, new)`: Replaces all occurrences of `old` in `s` with `new`.

Here are some examples of using these functions:

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// Contains
	fmt.Println(strings.Contains("hello world", "world")) // true

	// Split
	parts := strings.Split("hello,world,go", ",")
	fmt.Println(parts) // [hello world go]

	// Join
	joined := strings.Join(parts, "-")
	fmt.Println(joined) // hello-world-go

	// Trim
	trimmed := strings.Trim("Hello, World!", "!")
	fmt.Println(trimmed) // Hello, World

	// Replace
	replaced := strings.ReplaceAll("hello world", "world", "gopher")
	fmt.Println(replaced) // hello gopher
}
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/O9OjKRc200O).

### Printing Go Structs

Go provides a convenient way to print structs using the `%+v` format verb with
the `fmt.Printf` function. This verb prints the struct's field names and values.
It's a useful tool for debugging or inspecting the contents of a struct.

```go copy filename="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
    Name   string
    Age    int
    Email  string
}

func main() {
    p := Person{
        Name:  "John Doe",
        Age:   30,
        Email: "john@example.com",
    }

    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", p)
}
```

```plaintext filename="stdout"
{Name:John Doe Age:30 Email:john@example.com}
```

Try this in the Go playground [here](https://go.dev/play/p/URGekCy-Gma).
